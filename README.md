# simplified MIPS CPU Analyzer

Developed MIPS CPU Analyzer to experience the design issues of advanced computer architectures through the design of an analyzer for a simplified MIPS CPU using Python. The considered MIPS CPU adopts a multi-cycle pipeline processor to dynamically schedule instruction execution and employs caches in order to expedite memory access.
